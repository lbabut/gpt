## MousePosition Application

This repository contains a simple C# console application located in the `MousePosition` folder.
The application prints the mouse cursor position in real-time using `System.Windows.Forms`.

### Building and Running

You need the .NET SDK (6.0 or later) installed. From within the `MousePosition` directory, run:

```bash
# restore dependencies and build
 dotnet build

# run the application
 dotnet run
```

The console will display the cursor coordinates updating continuously.
